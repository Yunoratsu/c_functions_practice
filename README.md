# C Functions Practice

Just studying (or trying to) some C functions and memory internals.

## Goals

- Understand how some standard C functions work internally
- Practice implementing basic functionality manually (e.g., custom `malloc`, `free`)
- Learn more about memory, pointers, and system-level behavior in C

## Notes

This repository is just for personal learning and reference. I'm documenting my progress to look back on in the future.
